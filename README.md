- 👋 Hi, I’m @sharminiw
- 👀 I’m interested in software development as it has been a long time since I did any development and want to catchup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript especially ES6+ as my experience in javascript is more than 12 years ago.  Things have moved on since then :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to upskill my skill and to contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me by email
